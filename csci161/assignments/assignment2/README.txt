1) Image object a grayscale picture pixel-by-pixel, its name and its size (rows by columns);
2) A user can make a new empty Image with empty name; can get either name, number of rows or columns, pixels of existing Image; can make a new Image with given name, size and picture pixel-by-pixel; can copy one Image into another; can see if 2 Images are same or not (regardless of their names); can make an Image which is average of 2 Images of same size (name of a new one is names of 2 Images combined); can see a histogram of pixels (a user needs to enter a number of groups in which he/she wants to divide pixels into); enter or display Images as a whole;
3) In Image there are a string containing the name, 2 ints - number of rows and columns of pixels, and a 2-dimentional vector 1024/1024 - container of pixels. The main advantages of vector are a whole bunch of functions and ability to resize vector which don't work with normal arrays or pointers. Also resizing of vector can free some memory if it's needed. You can use normal array instead of vector, but you won't be able to return it with a function, which means that there will be no way to access pixels directly. You can also use pointer of array instead of vector;
4) All of the parts of the assignment are completed;
5) I have tested my function with a slightly modified main function just to swap the pointer in Image for vector, it works with it;
6) No bugs have came out during testing;
