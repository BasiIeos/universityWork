1) Compile the program using command make, execute the program with command ./pex3 and an option of what depth does the engine go to (default is 3)
2) Minimax algorithm is implemented in the minimax function in the c4player.h file; alpha-beta pruning is done in the same function.
3) Evaluation is based on how many moves it would take for the player to win. Score is positive if the player can win, 1 with his last chip, 2 with his pre-last chip and so on. Score is negative if the player loses no matter what, -1 if his opponent wins with last stone, etc.
4) There are many and the program basically does not work. The 2 that I have found are that it incorrectly evaluates if the position is already finished (if 1 player won) and it seg faults if the chip is placed on full column. I could not fix it in time, sorry.
5) Please just read the code and maybe give me some marks based on the logic. I know the program is not working and I do not deserve a lot of marks, but I believe the main ideas are done correctly. Thanks!
